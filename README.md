# 📈 Crop Price Prediction System - SIH 2024

Welcome to the **Crop Price Prediction System**, a data science and machine learning project developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024** by team **Xebec's Crew**.

This project focuses on predicting market prices of vegetables using historical data and time-series modeling techniques, with the ultimate goal of helping farmers make informed decisions on crop sales and logistics.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Domain:** Agriculture & Market Linkage  
**Challenge:** Predict future vegetable market prices using past data to support price transparency, optimize supply-chain decisions, and minimize post-harvest losses.

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

### ⚙️ 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you are using Python 3.8+. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 📥 2. Load and Preprocess the Data

```bash
python src/data_loader.py
python src/preprocessing.py
```

---

### 📊 3. Train Models

#### ARIMA Model:

```bash
python src/arima_model.py
```

#### LSTM Model:

```bash
python src/lstm_model.py
```

---

### 📈 4. Visualize Results

All generated plots (model loss, price forecasts, trend analysis) will be saved in the:

```bash
reports/figures/
```

---

## 📌 Features

* 📉 **ARIMA Model:** Classical time-series forecasting on crop price trends.
* 🧠 **LSTM Model:** Deep learning approach for better long-term dependency capture.
* 🧹 **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Normalization, time-indexing, and missing data handling.
* 📊 **Visual Reporting:** Forecast and evaluation plots.
* 📦 **Modular Codebase:** Separated scripts for easy testing and reusability.

---

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

You can find screenshots and output plots inside the `reports/figures/` folder. These illustrate the trends, predictions vs actual values, model evaluation metrics, etc.

---

## 📂 Dataset

We used the **Kalimati Tarkari Dataset** (publicly available), which contains:

* Historical prices of vegetables
* Market-level transaction volume
* Timestamped entries from Kalimati market

Path:
`data/raw/kalimati_tarkari_dataset.csv`

---

## 📑 Presentation

The `presentation/` folder contains the final PDF/PPT submission made for **SIH 2024**, including:

* Problem Statement
* Proposed Solution
* Architecture Diagrams
* Model Performance & Results
* Business Impact

---

## ✅ Future Scope

* Integrate with real-time APIs for live price predictions
* Deploy as a web dashboard using **Streamlit** or **FastAPI**
* Add more crops and markets across India
* Use Reinforcement Learning for decision making
