#  Crop Price Prediction System + Web Interface to publish results - SIH 2024

Welcome to the Crop Price Prediction System with Web Interface â€” a comprehensive Data Science, Machine Learning, and Web Development project developed by Team Xebecâ€™s Crew for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024.

This project is centered around forecasting market prices of vegetables using historical data and advanced time-series modeling techniques. The predicted results are then published on a dedicated web platform, aiming to support farmers and government agencies in making data-driven decisions related to crop sales, logistics, and timely market interventions.

# Development Section:
## Overview

The system is built with a **React frontend** and a **Flask + MongoDB backend**. It enables users to:

- Upload crop price datasets
- View predicted **intervention dates** based on LSTM+CNN model forecasts
- Allow admins to **post, update, and delete** results from a secure admin panel
- Store all uploaded datasets and results dynamically in MongoDB

**Note**: The LSTM+CNN model runs externally and is not part of this deployed web app. Instead, the web platform serves as a service interface for client interaction and result display.

## Features

- Upload datasets via a public user dashboard
- Secure admin login with session-based authentication
- Real-time admin panel to post, update, and delete results
- Dynamic result storage using MongoDB
- RESTful API endpoints to handle results and dataset uploads
- Mobile-responsive design using CSS
- Deployed frontend (React) via **Vercel**
- Deployed backend (Flask + MongoDB) via **Render**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Flask, MongoDB (via PyMongo), Gunicorn (for deployment), Python-dotenv
- **APIs**: REST APIs for all client-server communication
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment**:
  - React: Vercel
  - Flask: Render

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd Webpage/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-Create a .env file in Webpage/api with the following content:
 MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
-Then start the development server:
```bash
python app.py
```
### Frontend (React)
```bash
cd Webpage/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure you are using Python 3.8+. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Load and Preprocess the Data

```bash
python src/data_loader.py
python src/preprocessing.py
```

---





### 3. Train Models

#### ARIMA Model:

```bash
python src/arima_model.py
```

#### LSTM Model:

```bash
python src/lstm_model.py
```

---

### 4. Visualize Results

All generated plots (model loss, price forecasts, trend analysis) will be saved in the:

```bash
reports/figures/
```

---

## Features

*    **ARIMA Model:** Classical time-series forecasting on crop price trends.
*    **LSTM Model:** Deep learning approach for better long-term dependency capture.
*    **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Normalization, time-indexing, and missing data handling.
*    **Visual Reporting:** Forecast and evaluation plots.
*    **Modular Codebase:** Separated scripts for easy testing and reusability.

---

## Sample Visualizations

You can find screenshots and output plots inside the `reports/figures/` folder. These illustrate trends, predictions vs actual values, model evaluation metrics, etc.

---

## Dataset

We used the **Kalimati Tarkari Dataset** (publicly available), which contains:

* Historical prices of vegetables
* Market-level transaction volume
* Timestamped entries from Kalimati market

Path:
`data/raw/kalimati_tarkari_dataset.csv`

---

## Presentation

The `presentation/` folder contains the final PDF/PPT submission made for **SIH 2024**, including:

* Problem Statement
* Proposed Solution
* Architecture Diagrams
* Model Performance & Results
* Business Impact

---

## Future Scope

* Integrate the model into the Website.
* Add more crops and markets across India
* Use Reinforcement Learning for decision making
